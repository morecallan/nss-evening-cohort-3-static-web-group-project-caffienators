# Sharp Edges and Lead Paint
### An NSS group web store project

# Description
This group project was created as part of the *Static Web* portion of the **Nashville Software School** Front End curriculum.

Project requirements included:  
* At least three pages; each team member must create one page.
* All pages should share a unified theme and the same navigation bar.
* The project have a product page that displays at least 8 products.  The page should be driven by JavaScript from a separate main.js file.

We decided to use JavaScript to display both our products and our employees so that we could use two different JavaScript approaches.

# How to run it

  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`  or `http-server`
